title: How to Install Linux Kernel 4.4.265 on Ubuntu
breadcrumb: 4.4.265
excerpt: Linux Kernel 4.4.265

## Important Notes

This script will attempt to install Linux Kernel 4.4.265 on this machine. Typically, your current version will be kept, and you will be able to utilize it again later if Linux Kernel 4.4.265 does not work. However, it is possible, if unlikely, that this script will render your system inoperable on with certain software installed, or with certain hardware configurations. How to Ubuntu does not offer any guarantees whatsoever, but it worked for us. Use with care (especially around UEFI).

Also, note that your system will be running a package that it is unlikely to receive updates for, and that you will have to manually check for subsequent versions on How to Ubuntu.

Finally, it should be noted that this script will NOT automatically determine your system architecture, utilising only the amd64 packages for a 64bit system. ARM-type processors are not supported.
