## Cutting, Copying and Pasting in Ubuntu Terminal

In most applications Cut, Copy and Paste are <span class="box">Ctrl</span> + <span class="box">X</span>, <span class="box">Ctrl</span> + <span class="box">C</span> and <span class="box">Ctrl</span>+<span class="box">V</span> respectively.

In the Terminal, <span class="box">Ctrl</span>+<span class="box">C</span> is the cancel command. Use these in the Terminal instead:

To cut <span class="box">Ctrl</span> + <span class="box">Shift</span> + <span class="box">X</span>.

To copy <span class="box">Ctrl</span> + <span class="box">Shift</span> + <span class="box">C</span>.

To paste <span class="box">Ctrl</span> + <span class="box">Shift</span> + <span class="box">V</span>.
