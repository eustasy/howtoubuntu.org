### Release Date
Ubuntu 20.04 [was released](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseSchedule){:title="Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa Release Schedule"} on Thursday the 23rd of April 2020. Since then Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa has provided millions of users all over the world with a free, stable, secure operating system. Future point releases will reoccur every 6 months (you can upgrade as easily as updating, it just takes a little longer) in April and October.

### Long Term Support
Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa is a LTS release, and will be support for 5 Years until <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases">April 2025</a>. That makes it good for people who don't want to constantly change or to have to pay for upgrades. It is also a solid option for business or servers that don't want to major upgrades too often.

### Naming Ubuntu Releases

#### Numbers
The numbers part is easy, 20.04 was released on the 4th month of the year 2020. Ubuntu 19.10 was released on the 10th month (October) of 2019. Releases are every six months, numbered as 18.04, 18.10, 19.04, 19.10, 20.04, etc.

#### Adjectives
The first letter of the adjectives always match that of the animals. Like the animals, these are usually lesser known, obscure, or infamous in dome way.

#### Animals
Ubuntu release have always had the code-naming convention of an animal name as the second part, preceded by an adjective beginning with the same letter. Apart from the first two releases (back in 2004/5), they have been working through the alphabet (starting at B and missing C). While the animals honored in this way are not necessarily unheard of, many of them are either uncommon or infamous in some way.

> "The fossa is the largest mammalian carnivore on Madagascar and has been compared to a small cougar, as it has convergently evolved many cat-like features. Adults have a head-body length of 70–80 cm (28–31 in) and weigh between 5.5 and 8.6 kg (12 and 19 lb), with the males larger than the females. It has semi-retractable claws (meaning it can extend but not retract its claws fully) and flexible ankles that allow it to climb up and down trees head-first, and also support jumping from tree to tree. A larger relative of the species, Cryptoprocta spelea, probably became extinct before 1400."
