## Release & Support Cycle
Release and support cycles are predominantly in two flavours, long and short. Short cycles practically require upgrades twice a year (similar to a modern Windows system, whereas Long cycles require major upgrades only after several years of stable operation. Because Ubuntu operates on a process of [Time Based Releases](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases) with set deadlines, rather than waiting for all known issues to be resolved, both the release date and the presence of issues and bugs are reliable.

- LTS: Released every **2 years**, supported for 5 years. First point release after 4 months.
- Non-LTS: Released every **6 months**, supported for 9 months. Every forth release is replaced by an LTS release.

This has lead to a common practice of many users administering large fleets: running LTS releases only after waiting several months for the first of the point releases, usually released in August after the April release in any even-numbered year. These are then run in a leapfrog fashion to avoid upgrading entire fleets of machines on a more regular basis. Alternating LTS on 100 computers result in ~25 upgrades a year, versus 200 upgrades a year on a non-lts release.

## Naming Ubuntu Releases

### Numbers
The numbers in the name relate to the year and month of release. 20.04 was released on the 4th month of the year 2020. Ubuntu 19.10 was released on the 10th month (October) of 2019. Releases are scheduled every six months, numbered as 18.04, 18.10, 19.04, 19.10, 20.04, etc. Occaisionally, you may see a third number in a LTS release name: these are point releases, that include newer hardware support from non-LTS releases that have been backported.

### Adjectives
The first letter of the adjectives always match that of the animals. Like the animals, these are usually lesser known, obscure, or infamous in dome way.

### Animals
Ubuntu release have always had the code-naming convention of an animal name as the second part, preceded by an adjective beginning with the same letter. Apart from the first two releases (back in 2004/5), they have been working through the alphabet (starting at B and missing C). While the animals honored in this way are not necessarily unheard of, many of them are either uncommon or infamous in some way.
